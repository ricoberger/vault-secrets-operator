# Set the address for vault (by default we assume you are running a dev
# instance of vault in the same namespace as the operator) and specify the
# authentication method for the operator.  Possible values are 'token',
# 'kubernetes', or 'approle'.

# If the authentication method is 'kubernetes' the Helm chart
# ensures that the Service Account included the needed rights. The default path
# for the Kubernets Auth method is 'auth/kubernetes', if you enabled it under
# another path you must change the 'kubernetesPath' value. You must also
# provide the role which should be used for the authentication.
#
# If the auth method is 'token' you can specify the 'tokenPath' to read the
# Vault token from a mounted volume instead of an environment variable.
#
# If the auth method is 'approle' you must specify a path for the AppRole Auth
# method with 'appRolePath', by default it is 'auth/approle'. Also
# 'VAULT_ROLE_ID' and 'VAULT_SECRET_ID' must be set for this auth method. With
# this method, the renewal interval is set by default to a half of the token
# lease duration (can be overwritten with 'VAULT_TOKEN_RENEWAL_INTERVAL'), the
# token maximum TTL is set by default to 1382400 seconds (16 days, can be
# overwritten with 'VAULT_TOKEN_MAX_TTL').
#
# The reconciliationTime value determines after which time the Vault secret is
# processed again. This can be used to update a the Kubernetes secret, when the
# Vault secret changes. A value of 0 will disable the automatic update.
# You can specify all namespaces the operator should watch. Therefore pass a
# comma separated list via the namespaces value. If the value is empty the operator
# will watch all namespaces. If the value is empty and rbac.namespaced is set to
# true, then the namespace of the release will be used.
