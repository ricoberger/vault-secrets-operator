environmentVars:
  # Set environment variables from a secret. This must be done, if you use the
  # Token Auth Method of Vault.
  # - envName: VAULT_TOKEN
  #   secretName: vault-secrets-operator
  #   secretKey: VAULT_TOKEN
  # - envName: VAULT_TOKEN_LEASE_DURATION
  #   secretName: vault-secrets-operator
  #   secretKey: VAULT_TOKEN_LEASE_DURATION

# Set the address for vault (by default we assume you are running a dev
# instance of vault in the same namespace as the operator) and specify the
# authentication method for the operator.  Possible values are 'token' or
# 'kubernetes'. If the authentication method is 'kubernetes' the Helm chart
# ensures that the Service Account included the needed rights. The default path
# for the Kubernets Auth method is 'auth/kubernetes', if you enabled it under
# another path you must change the 'kubernetesPath' value. You must also
# provide the role which should be used for the authentication.
# If the auth method is 'token' you can specify the 'tokenPath' to read the
# Vault token from a mounted volume instead of an environment variable.
# The reconciliationTime value determines after which time the Vault secret is
# processed again. This can be used to update a the Kubernetes secret, when the
# Vault secret changes. A value of 0 will disable the automatic update.
# You can specify all namespaces the operator should watch. Therefor pass a
# comma separated list via the namespaces value. If the value is empty the operator
# will watch all namespaces.

  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
