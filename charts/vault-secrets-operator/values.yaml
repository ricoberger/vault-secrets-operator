# Set the address for vault (by default we assume you are running a dev
# instance of vault in the same namespace as the operator) and specify the
# authentication method for the operator.  Possible values are 'token' or
# 'kubernetes'. If the authentication method is 'kubernetes' the Helm chart
# ensures that the Service Account included the needed rights. The default path
# for the Kubernets Auth method is 'auth/kubernetes', if you enabled it under
# another path you must change the 'kubernetesPath' value. You must also
# provide the role which should be used for the authentication.
# If the auth method is 'token' you can specify the 'tokenPath' to read the
# Vault token from a mounted volume instead of an environment variable.
# The reconciliationTime value determines after which time the Vault secret is
# processed again. This can be used to update a the Kubernetes secret, when the
# Vault secret changes. A value of 0 will disable the automatic update.
# You can specify all namespaces the operator should watch. Therefor pass a
# comma separated list via the namespaces value. If the value is empty the operator
# will watch all namespaces. Namespaces are ignored if rbac.namespaced is set to
# true, then the namespace of the release will be used
