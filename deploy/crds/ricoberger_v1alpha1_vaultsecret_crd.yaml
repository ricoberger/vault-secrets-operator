              description: isBinary is a flag indicates if data stored in vault is 
                binary data. Since vault does not store binary data natively, 
                the binary data is stored as base64 encoded. However, same data get encoded
                again when operator stored them as secret in k8s which caused the data to 
                get double encoded. This flag will skip the base64 encode which is needed 
                for string data to avoid the double encode problem.
